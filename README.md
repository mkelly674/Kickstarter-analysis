# Kickstarter-analysis

The Purpose of the Project

    We have looked at all these kickstarters for Louis who wants to do a kickstarter as well to do a play. The purpose for why we
    looked at the amount of kickstarters is because of how accurate a big sample size will be. 
    
Challeges and Overcoming them

    One of the challeges that I had completing this project is getting the amount of successes and fails for the different number of 
    goals. Learning how to use new formulas is always going to be a challege, but with brute force and a lot of time, I was able to 
    overcome that difficulty.
    
 Results
 
    I have concluded that May and June have the best successes and the most launches. Another conclusion that I have is that January
    and December are the worst times to launch a kickstarter. Based on Goals, I have concluded that anything over $5,000 for a goal
    will have a sharp decline in possibly succeeding. Some limitations that this dataset has is the goals are heavily skewed in both
    the lower goal amount and the number of kickstarters starting in the summertime. Another table that I would use to get a better
    understading of it is a bar graph comparing successes between each catagory to get an understading of possible skews that the
    theater catagory is showing and whether or not it is just in that one catagory.
